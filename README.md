# Learning-Contract

I have multiple Pluralsight courses that my manager sent to me. 

I started with learning about all of the different use cases for Java and how popular it is.
Setting up a Java development environment.
My main focus has been the Fundamentals of Java. 
Examples of the content covered:
-Variables, data types and math operators
-Conditional logic and block statements
-arrays and loops
-strings
-dates and time in Java
-understanding and handling exceptions
-reference types and nulls
-annotations
-collections
-lambda expressions
-map and filter data
-logging
-object orientation

I plan on rebuilding the back end of my week 9 project with Java next week.
